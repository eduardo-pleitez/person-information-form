# Person Information Form

## Form and Konami Code
## Description
In this project we create a form that request person information. We check if the information provided 
by the user is valid and show the valid information introduce on the console and a list of errors for 
the information that is invalid on the form. We implemented a Konami Code to this project where a 
sequence of keys activates a function that displays a gif on the screen using time out function that 
shows the gif for five seconds on the screen.

This project was created using HTML, pure CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

## Learning
This project was good learning experience. I learn to use DOM manipulation events, to validate input 
data, to add event listeners to the page, to display data and to use git commands.

## Secret Code for Konami Code
The secret code to activate the gif is the word: react (R-E-A-C-T)
